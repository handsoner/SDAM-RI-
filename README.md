Abstract
To address the domain shift challenges commonly encountered in cross-institutional and cross-device biomedical spectroscopy data, this study proposes a Single-source Domain Adaptive disease diagnosis model based on Multimodal fusion of Raman and Infrared spectroscopy (SDAM-RI). The model aims to enhance generalization and accuracy in unlabeled data scenarios. The proposed framework innovatively integrates two complementary vibrational spectroscopies—Raman and infrared—through a co-attention mechanism to deeply fuse cross-modal features. The domain adaptation framework disentangles domain-specific and domain-invariant information, employing adversarial training and contrastive learning to minimize distributional discrepancies between the source and target domains. Multimodal fusion provides a more comprehensive biochemical representation, while the adaptation mechanism aligns cross-domain features in the fused subspace, jointly improving robustness and generalizability. Experiments on cancer and autoimmune disease spectroscopy datasets demonstrate that SDAM-RI significantly outperforms multiple classical baselines, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy in target domains. Visualization analysis further confirms the model’s ability to learn highly discriminative features from spectral data. By focusing on biologically relevant spectral fingerprints rather than device-dependent artifacts, SDAM-RI provides a powerful and general solution to the domain adaptation challenge in multimodal vibrational spectroscopy data.
